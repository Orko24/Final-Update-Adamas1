Build an virtual enviornment (preferably conda)
use torch command and requirements to install all dependencies

run cmd terminals with conda activate <virtual env name>

3 seperate instances of it (windows development env may vary to linux):

1) redis-server
2) python manage.py runserver
3) celery -A <"proj_name".celery> worker -l info -P eventlet
4) rqworker -w rq_win.WindowsWorker

NOTE: in the case for this file:


celery -A mysite.celery worker -l info -P eventlet

will work

add concurrency 
celery -A mysite.celery worker -l info --concurrency=10 -P eventlet
celery -A mysite.celery worker -l info --concurrency=1 -P eventlet

Use Django RQ for machine learning task, use this template as 
base to integrate Django RQ Celery Django Redis as well as any external apps designed 


unix: python manage.py rqworker default

windows: rqworker -w rq_win.WindowsWorker

To do, integrate them into a linux system later and use a bash file to run everything and terminate 
everything at once to keep servers streamlined
